Dear $1,

Please find below a 660-word op-ed explaining why President Trump's travel ban is unconstitutional.

I am an attorney and writer based in Denver and a former judicial clerk at the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. My articles have been appeared in publications including the Philadelphia Inquirer, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Stanford Journal of International Law, and Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Ryan McCarl
